# PaxVision

PaxVision is a reaction system founded under the idea of minimizing damage done through public shooting by detecting guns through Computer Vision. Utilizing Microsoft's Custom Vision API, PaxVision is an approach to a sensible alarm system developed against the recently rising problem regarding gun violence.

## Getting Started

Run PaxVision.py within the repository to run the entire program.

## Deployment

We are envisioning Pax Vision to be implemented in public and school areas' alarm system, in order to provide a 'gun alarm' in the area.

## Built With

* [Jupyter Notebook] - Used for entire development
* [Microsoft Custom Vision API] - Used for Object Identification
* [OpenCV] - Used for main video feed input
